                      <p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Schedulogy we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
                    <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
                    <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
                    <li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, this policy is based on the policy available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license from <a href="https://schedulogy.com/">automattic.com</a>.</p>
                <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <a href="mailto:info@schedulogy.com">contact us</a>.</p>
                <p>Lukas Korous (“<strong>Schedulogy</strong>”) is the sole owner and operator of the website <a href="https://schedulogy.com/">schedulogy.com</a>.
                    It is Schedulogy’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>
                <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
                <p>Like most website operators, Schedulogy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Schedulogy’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Schedulogy’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Schedulogy may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>Schedulogy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Schedulogy only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
                <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>Visitors who choose to use Schedulogy web or mobile application are asked to provide a single piece of personally-identifying information - the email address. Schedulogy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
                <p>Schedulogy may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Schedulogy may monitor number of Users / Calendars / Tasks in the SCHEDULOGY web / mobile app. Schedulogy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>Schedulogy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Schedulogy’s behalf or to provide services available at Schedulogy’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Schedulogy’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Schedulogy will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Schedulogy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Schedulogy believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Schedulogy, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Schedulogy website and have supplied your email address, Schedulogy may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Schedulogy and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Schedulogy takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Schedulogy uses cookies to help Schedulogy identify and track visitors, their usage of Schedulogy website, and their website access preferences. Schedulogy visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Schedulogy’s website, with the drawback that certain features of Schedulogy’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>If Schedulogy, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Schedulogy goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Schedulogy may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

                <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Schedulogy may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Schedulogy’s sole discretion. Schedulogy encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
